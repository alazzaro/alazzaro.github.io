# Call for Contributions at "2nd High Performance Computing meets Quantum Computing" (HPC+QC'25)

## Synopsis

As part of the [PASC'25 Conference](https://pasc25.pasc-conference.org/), we would like to submit a full proposal for a [Minisymposium](https://pasc25.pasc-conference.org/submission/guidelines-for-minisymposia/) on the subject of "High Performance Computing meets Quantum Computing". This is the 2nd edition of the [Minisymposium we organized at PASC'24](https://pasc24.pasc-conference.org/session/?sess=sess160).

During the Minisymposium, researchers and developers will discuss their experiences with applications development with Quantum Computing (QC) algorithms, specifically related to the integration of applications currently running on "traditional" HPC systems, which aim to use QC devices as an accelerator. Considered topics are:
- theoretical development of QC algorithms;
- QC software development;
- Integration of QC systems with the existing HPC infrastructure;
- Use QC as an accelerator for HPC applications.
- QC simulations.

## Present your work at the 2nd HPC+QC'25!

The Minisymposium comprises 4 presentations (25-minute talks with 5 minutes for Q&A). 
People can apply by submitting the following information:
- presentation title 
- a short abstract
- name of speaker (only a single speaker is allowed by the conference)
- List of the authors and institutions

Please send the information to <alfio.lazzaro@hpe.com> and <tiziano.mueller@hpe.com>. **The deadline is 22 December 2024 (AoE)**.  
Then, we will use this information to shape and submit the full proposal at the PASC conference website.

## Important points

The selection is based on "first come, first served," so it is highly encouraged that you send an email with your intention to participate as soon as possible. 

Following the rules of the [PASC'25 conference](https://pasc25.pasc-conference.org/submission/guidelines-for-minisymposia/), we will give priority to speakers at an early career researcher: "One of the four speakers must be an early career researcher". _A speaker is considered early-career if they have less than 7 years of full-time experience in the field since their last degree (the 7-year window may be extended for extenuating circumstances such as parental or medical leave)._

Furthermore, presenters must come from different institutions (two speakers from the same institution presenting in the same session will not be accepted). The conference allows *only one talk* to be presented per speaker throughout the conference program.

There is no promise that the Minisymposium will take place at PASC'25 should until notified that the second stage submission proposal has been accepted for presentation within the conference program (notification on 06 February 2025). If the proposal is accepted then presentation titles and abstracts (200 words) will be requested from each speaker (deadline 07 March 2025). 

**Please keep in mind that speakers are NOT invited and remote participation is NOT possible. They have to pay for themselves the full conference fee (possibly discounted depending on status).** Please check the [website](https://pasc25.pasc-conference.org/) of the conference for more details.
